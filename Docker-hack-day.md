Chris Piccaro came to talk about Docker

Docker is a replacement for a virtual machine so you can run programs that can only be run on different operating systems

As long as the docker file is set  up correctly, it will run on everyon'es computer the exact same way.  Have the same dev environment even if you don't have certain things installed.  You can also use it to see how an app looks without installing it on your computer if you're concerned about it.

Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers â€” small and lightweight execution environments that make shared use of the operating system kernel but otherwise run in isolation from one another.

image is like a snapshot or set of instructions and a container is an instance of it
