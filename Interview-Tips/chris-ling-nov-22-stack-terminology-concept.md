Stack, Terminology and concept interviews

What?- A Q&A format that doesn't require an interviewee to write code, but to instead talk about a language, CS concept, technology, best practices, etc.  


## Interview components:

1. Do you know your/our stack?  
If you're a react developer, do you know the lifecycle methods?  Can you tell me why I would want to use a React hook instead of a class?  Have you ever worked in a PHP codebase with a MariaDB database?

1. Do you know CS terminology?
What is a dependency injection?  Can you tell me the difference between concurrency and parallelism?

1. Do you know best practices and software patterns?


## Interview formats:

Usually a recruiter or engineer performs these.  Lots of questions specific to the job description.  Be able to make the relationships between languages/technologies and apply it toward what they're asking you.

asks questions related to their codebases and domains, either granular or more open-ended.

## General Practice Strategies:

Job applications determine your studying requirements

1. Find overlapping tech stacks and roles.  
Knowing more about what types of jobs you'd like to be applying to you can focus your studies around those concepts  i.e. front end/ back-end.

1. Find equivalent tech stacks.  If we only know JavaScript and we apply to a Java job, we're going to have to learn completely new paradigms.  But if we know React, we could probably pick up Vue on the job.

Find the examples of using stuff in your tech-stack and relate it.  i.e. I know mongoDB so I could probably learn Dyno easily for the job.

1. Don't oversell your credentials.
If we use buzzwords on the resume, expect to get asked about them with specificity.  We're responsible for backing up our credentials with credibility.

1. Don't study everything.  
Find out what the most important requirements are.  Explore *stackshare.io* to see what common tech companies are using.

1. Study before you get an interview.
If we've applied to job thoughtfully, most of the jobs will require similar STC knowledge.

1. Context matters. 
When we learn a phrase or concept, try to find a specific example in our code, and practice presenting that example.  If we don't have an example in our code, build a PoC (Proof of Concept).

1. Repetition matters.
We need to study STCs consistently and frequently.  Flashcards is one example of a learning aid that has kinesthetic (writing the card), visual (looking at the card), and audio (reading the question and answering aloud) components to it.

1. We don't always know what to study.

Answer the right question the right way
1. Keep definitions short and sweet.  

1. Admit limitations, ask for clarity.  
Maybe we can infer a concept 


It's always good to start with user stories and organization/architecture when answering a
