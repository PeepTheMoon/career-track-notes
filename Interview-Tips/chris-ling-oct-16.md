To practice code challenges:
  1. LeetCode
  1. CodeWars
  1. Blind

Common interview types:
  1. Stack, terminology, or concept interviews
  1. Ownership or retro interviews
  1. Data structures and algorithms interviews
  1. Product or system design interviews
  1. Data engineering or analytics interviews
  1. Deploy an app interviews

Stack, terminology or concept interviews (STC)
Whats? a q&a format that doesn't require an interviewee to write code, but to talk about it instead.
- language
- cs concept
- technology
- best practices

Typically encountered during screening/initial interviews.

Tip: a lot of this is rote memorization.  Flash cards are good to test yourself.  On key (app) to build flashcards and test yourself.  Allows you to perform educated guesses.  Talk about what you know, get interviewer to provide context, and talk about what you DO know about something.


Ownership or retro interviews
what? A long form discussion where you're asked to deep dive into a significatnt past project, from ideation to architecture to implementation.  You may draw out the architecture or workflow, or navigate through your codebase (if it's a personal project).  Can be asked during a screener in 30 min version or 1 hr during an onsite.

Tip:  draw out your architecture on paper or using an app, and practice describing your app by referrnig to this visual diagram.  


Data structures and algorithms interviews

What?  An interview that tests computer science concepts through writing and/or executing code to perform some discrete task or to implement some algorithmic logic.  Requires a strong fundamental knowledge of vanilla coding, an understanding of optimization (big-O) and scalability, and the ability to plan and communicate your plan to an interviewer.  No need to create an app.  

Example formats:
- single coding challenge 30min-1hr
- rapid fire series of simple algorithms/coding (~10 questions) over an hour.
- multiple challenges that build on a single algorithms problem.

Tip: read Grokking Algorithms and sign up for Leet Code (can filter by data type or even company!) or Code Wars


Product or System design interviews

What?  An interview that tests your ability to build a hypothetical product within software or data storage format, with an emphasis on understanding product stakeholders, the user stories to solve through technology, the basic types of software ot data convention you need (API endpoints, data models), and how this architecture should scale over time, user base, and usage.

Example:
- Build a hypothetical to Yelp.com.  How would we enter into this space?
- We want to create a micro service to get user feedback on our product.  What do we need?
- Create a system that gets up-to-date real estate market data to help build a predictive model.

Tip:
Look at favorite apps that you use in real life.  Try to reverse engineer the MVP for this app (their 1.0).


Data engineering or analytics interviews

What?  An interview that inherits flavors of other interviews, but in the context of solving questions related to the modeling, storage, transformation, and analysis of big data.  Problems are framed in terms of extract or transform, and load (ETL) processes, SQL query construction and optimization, data modeling, consuming data in batches v. streams, and creating metrics for product benchmarks.

Example:
- create data models for a hypothetical platform for peer-to-peer bartering.
- based on the provided database tables, what metrics can we design to reflect app usage?
- explore a publicly available dataset and highlight interesting observations in a presentation.

Tip:
take a deeper dive into learning a database engine (SQL or NoSQL) and practice writing queries using PostgreSQL Exercises (app or site?) and LeetCode


Deploy an App interview
What?  An interview that has you build an MVP or toy app based on a closed universe of info and a list of requirements.  Depending on the time frame (1, 4, 24, 48 hrs), these requirements will be more complex.  Typically requires libraries/frameworks in web app development (React, Redux, visualization libraries, etc).

Example:
- create an app that displays daily weather data and an interactive time series graph
- create a version of rock, paper, scissors that can be played against a computer.
- create an app that displays image data from an API in a responsive format.

Tip:
Build muscle memory in practicing deploying "hello world" apps and kow a few siple visualization libraries (chart.js or victory) and quality-of-life libraries (Lodash).
