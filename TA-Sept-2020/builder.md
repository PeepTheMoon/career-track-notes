# [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/)

Allows for marketing and non-developer control over editing parts of a website.

Visual content creation allows non-developers to edit the site, and works with any tech stack.  Allows devs to leverage existing code.

You edit right on the actual website in builder.  All new content added inherits styling and typographies.

Everything is already web responsive and SEO-optimized.

You can control who has permissions to edit styling vs content.  Those with styling permissions can save things as templates for later.

You can test A/B variations

You can segment your traffic and show different content to different visitors.

Builder auto-tracks a range of insights so you can see from your segmentation or A/B tests which content is converting best and why (conversion tracking), and can also sync this with your custom analytics.

You can schedule content to be live during a certain time period.
