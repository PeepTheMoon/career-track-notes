 STAR methodology in interviews:

 -research who you'll be interviewing with.  
 Think about how your past experience shows how you will perform in the future.

 -Develop a list of questions to ask!

 -Look for website where you can find someone's email.

# The STAR format stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result:
-Situation: An event, project, or challenge faced
-Task: Your responsibilities and assignments for the situation
-Action: Steps or procedure taken to relieve or rectify situation
-Result: Results of actions taken.

*Use the STAR method for behavioral interview questions.  Situational interview questions focus on speculative events in the future. Instead of giving the interviewer an actual event and how you handled it from your past work experience(behavioral), a situational answer considers how you might act in a situation that might happen in the company’s future.*

Step 1. Using the STAR method to answer this question, we’ll first start with describing the situation.
Step 2. Next, we’ll give them the task.
Step 3. Then the action taken to solve the problem.
Step 4. And finally, the result of your actions.

*When answering in the STAR formula, use the first person singular - “I did such-and-such” rather than “we did such-and-such” - it will keep the focus on you.  Be sure to answer the acronyms in order!*

 1. Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult team member and how you overcame it.
-I worked on a back-end project with a team using mongoose models in a fully remote environment.  We were building a MUD game and we were determining how to handle state.  This was something which took awhile, because we had to navigate whether to put state on instances of the room or on the user.  We only had 5 days to build, test and deploy the application, and one of our teammates had difficulty reaching a decision.  I suggested we reach out to a more senior developer for their opinion and some guidance, but the teammate was still indecisive.  We had reached a point where we couldn't move forward with the project until we reached a decision, so my approach was to 1. Clarify the suggestions made by the senior dev, 2. Discuss with the team how they felt about that approach, 3. Voice my opinion on it, and how I thought it could be of help, then 4. Suggest we go ahead and try it that way for hitting our MVP, then coming back and refactoring it if we found it would be more beneficial when we had more time.  The result was that we were able to move forward with the project, we hit our MVP later that day which was day 2 of the project, and then it left a lot more time for us to hit our stretch goals.  We did end up refactoring our state handling, and it was good that we went the route we did.  It enabled us to flesh the application out further which helped us to have a more informed decision about the best way to handle state for our application, and we had plenty of time to make those changes without any stress because we had already hit our MVP and if it didn't work, we could easily revert to a fully functioning application.

-I worked on a full-stack app with a team of 5.  This was my first time building a full-stack application with a team, and I was also the team lead for this project.  We were tasked with developing, testing and deploying this application in a 4 day sprint.  This was a fully remote project, which can make team projects more difficult because we're not all sharing the same space.  During this time, I noticed that one team member would get talked over regularly by another, and she would quiet down and not speak up about what she was going to say.  During these times, I made sure to ask her what she was going to say so we could all hear her insight, but she began to be less vocal over the next day.  I reached out privately and told her what I noticed about her quieting down, and that I wanted to make sure she was feeling heard and that her ideas were respected.  She appreciated the note, gave me more insight into how the situation was making her feel, and as we broke off into tasks, she would regularly reach out when she encountered the same issues with the other team mate.  I encouraged her to take more breaks to collect herself and de-stress and welcomed her to come work with me or another teammate as she felt she needed to.  I also arranged some end-of-day standups for team-building to watch something funny together and share a drink to celebrate our accomplishments.  The result was that she felt she received the respect she deserved, felt understood and valued on the team, and we were able to meet our deadline and leave everyone feeling good about our project and about others on the team.  

1. Tell me something difficult you’ve done.
I noticed there were unmet needs in the health food industry, which I had worked in for many years at the time.  I wanted to start my own business to fulfill those needs, which primarily involved direct consumer marketing and education.  I began to network with sales reps, store managers, and directly with companies that I liked.  I took initiative by setting up a business plan, getting business cards, and gained exposure to key people within the industry strategically by attending major trade shows and events.  Here I made a good impression, discussed my plan and how I could help them, and returned from my first trade show with 5 new clients.  Suddenly I had a full business.  I worked in different stores throughout the region I lived in, establishing a good reputation from using science-based education methods.  My business grew word-of-mouth, and I gradually took on more roles as I saw needs grow.  I ended up evolving my business into managing two states, the PNW territory, expanding my business into a brokerage, and at one time had two employees.  

1. Tell me about a time someone on your team didn’t complete a task and how you went about it.
-I worked on a full-stack app with a team of 5 in a 5 day sprint in a fully remote environment.  This team had members of varying skill levels.  One person in particular felt like he wasn't able to contribute very much to the project code-wise.  I was the leader of this team, and before we got started, I asked everyone to talk a little about what they wanted to work on, what they would like to learn more about, and where they felt they could use the most help.  I divided up the tasks accordingly, and made sure to include the team member who had less confidence in his skills in pair-programming and research tasks to give him an opportunity to learn, which helped him to feel better about his role and contributions to the project.  We deployed the application, hitting our MVP, and were able to include many of our stretch goals for the project.

1. Tell me about a time you worked with a good team, what that felt like, and what your part in it was.
-I worked on a full-stack stargazing application on a team with 3 other people in a 5 day sprint in a fully remote environment.  I loved working with this team, because we kept ourselves open, flexible, and had a good sense of humor when things didn't work out how we anticipated.  We all took the first day to plan the application, do research, talk about our wire frames, possible features, new libraries we might want to use and why, and write out tickets.  This was my brainchild, and I did a lot of research into APIs we could use to accomplish our goals for the application.  Unfortunately, finding an API that would return the results we needed was extremely difficult.   We had initially planned our app around finding an API of constellations but the closest thing I could find were two graphical simulation planetariums. We chose Virtual Sky for our planetarium and we decided to supplement that data with a weather API which returned astronomical data like sunset, moonrise, moon phase and moon illumination to give the user more data for planning their stargazing excursions.  The result was a really fun, interactive, feature-rich app that had a lot of UX consideration.  It was well-rounded, and the most fun project I've ever worked on.



## Commonly asked behavioral questions:
1. Tell me about a time you had a conflict at work.
S- An organic product line for expecting mothers and new babies hired me to do demos and merchandising.  
T- The company owner, who I was trained and paid by, asked me to check on the testers in each store I visited.
A- I went through and collected all of the testers that needed to be replaced, and sent in a list of stores and items for them to send out.
R- The brokerage that managed the line in the territory I worked in called and said they were very upset because I didn't follow protocol.  I explained the situation and what the owner asked me to do, that I wasn't given any protocol by the brokerage for me to follow with regard to testers, and that I sincerely did the best I could with no disrespect.  The sales rep from the brokerage thanked me and explained that she had misunderstood.  We still have a good working relationship between my company and the brokerage, and this became a good opportunity for us to clear up our communication on what we each expected and needed of the other in our work together for the company/line.


2. Can you describe a stressful situation and how you handled it?


3. Can you detail a mistake you made and how you reacted to it?

4. Tell me about a time when you performed well under enormous pressure.
Situation: Starting classes right before the pandemic, no income, large loans, time consuming, cognitively demanding, not getting pua, dealing with a hit and run on my parked vehicle, supporting blm, all while fully remote and quarantined from loved ones.  Task: learn software engineering in a fast-paced environment, with stacked modules (so you never feel comfortable) with absolutely no previous experience.  Action: I devoted myself to the class, participating fully, attending every lecture and improving upon old lab projects until I understood.  I did a lot of informational interviews and got advice through networking, and I put in the time-- sometimes 14 hours per day.  Result: I am in a place where I'm more confident about my abilities, I've learned a lot about myself and what I want from a job, a company, and a team. I adapted to the stresses and I maintained a 98.2% GPA.

5. Have you ever dealt with a sticky situation involving another department?

6. Give me an example of a goal you met.

7. Give me an example of a goal you couldn't meet and how you handled it.
S- I had been ready for a change in my career, and I thought long and deeply about which direction to turn.  I finally landed on counseling. 
T- I attended some info sessions and enrolled in some required classes in order to apply for the master's programs.
A- I attended postgrad classes and took a deep dive into my psyche and my shadow self.  I learned a lot and confronted a lot of family issues.  Afterwards I applied for a couple of different programs, rallied support from past instructors, coworkers and managers, and sent off the paperwork with high hopes.
R- Sadly, I wasn't accepted into either program.  I value the experience, and learned that I want to use my empathy skills while working with others and accomplishing shared goals.

8. Tell me about a time when you had to placate an unsatisfied client.

9. Have you ever had a disagreement with an immediate supervisor?

10. Describe a time when you went above and beyond.
A customer at a store I was working at came to my table.  I was sampling out supplements and offering discounts to increase sales for the store.  We discussed the products I was presenting, they tried samples, and asked questions.  I gave them the information they were looking for and were interested in trying the product, but wanted to wait for another time to buy.  I offered them a full-size product from my own car stock as a gift with purchase if they purchased today, and they thought it was such a good deal that they couldn't pass it up.  They purchased the item and I went to get the free item for them, plus some additional samples from the line for them to try, as well as recipes that I use at home with the supplement.  They were very pleased and became regular customers.

11. “Tell me about a time you failed at a task you were assigned…”

12. “Have you ever had to work with someone you didn’t like? How did you handle that?”

13. “How do you handle setting goals? Can you give an example?”
