Explicitly state why you're a great fit.  
When talking about  a project, talk about the project, talk about your role on the team, and talk about a problem you encountered and how you solved it.

Personal website:
connect to github, there's an api to show your stack, what you write in.

In interviews, ask the company where you can be with them in 5 years!

Ask Jaime about her experience in the tech crawl.  What did she learn?  What companies did she like and why?
 What about the one's that she didn't?

 Add a readme to my github, add my websites when they're ready.  
 Put a link to github on my resume and portfolio site.

 STAR methodology in interviews:

 -research who you'll be interviewing with.  
 Think about how your past experience shows how you will perform in the future.

 -Develop a list of questions to ask!

 -Look for website where you can find someone's email.

 STAR QUESTIONS PRACTICE:
specific situation, 
task, 
action, and 
result of the situation you are describing.


 1. Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult team member and how you overcame it.
-I worked on a back-end project with a team using mongoose models in a fully remote environment.  We were building a MUD game and we were determining how to handle state.  This was something which took awhile, because we had to navigate whether to put state on instances of the room or on the user.  We only had 5 days to build, test and deploy the application, and one of our teammates had difficulty reaching a decision.  I suggested we reach out to a more senior developer for their opinion and some guidance, but the teammate was still indecisive.  We had reached a point where we couldn't move forward with the project until we reached a decision, so my approach was to 1. Clarify the suggestions made by the senior dev, 2. Discuss with the team how they felt about that approach, 3. Voice my opinion on it, and how I thought it could be of help, then 4. Suggest we go ahead and try it that way for hitting our MVP, then coming back and refactoring it if we found it would be more beneficial when we had more time.  The result was that we were able to move forward with the project, we hit our MVP later that day which was day 2 of the project, and then it left a lot more time for us to hit our stretch goals.  We did end up refactoring our state handling, and it was good that we went the route we did.  It enabled us to flesch the application out further which helped us to have a more informed decision about the best way to handle state for our application, and we had plenty of time to make those changes without any stress because we had already hit our MVP and if it didn't work, we could easily revert to a fully functioning application.

-I worked on a full-stack app with a team of 5.  This was my first time building a full-stack application with a team, and I was also the team lead for this project.  We were tasked with developing, testing and deploying this application in a 4 day sprint.  This was a fully remote project, which can make team projects more difficult because we're not all sharing the same space.  During this time, I noticed that one team member would get talked over regularly by another, and she would quiet down and not speak up about what she was going to say.  During these times, I made sure to ask her what she was going to say so we could all hear her insight, but she began to be less vocal over the next day.  I reached out privately and told her what I noticed about her quieting down, and that I wanted to make sure she was feeling heard and that her ideas were respected.  She appreciated the note, gave me more insight into how the situation was making her feel, and as we broke off into tasks, she would regularly reach out when she encountered the same issues with the other team mate.  I encouraged her to take more breaks to collect herself and de-stress and welcomed her to come work with me or another teammate as she felt she needed to.  I also arranged some end-of-day standups for team-building to watch something funny together and share a drink to celebrate our accomplishments.  The result was that she felt she received the respect she deserved, felt understood and valued on the team, and we were able to meet our deadline and leave everyone feeling good about our project and about others on the team.  

1. Tell me something difficult you’ve done.
Starting a business and running that business top to bottom.
Starting it myself, running it myself.  Building it from promotions to working at trade shows, expos, doing trainings, nutritional consultations, and eventually adding on more territory.  Built it into a brokerage.  Had two people working for me.  managing two states of territory. 

1. Tell me about a time someone on your team didn’t complete a task and how you went about it.
-I worked on a full-stack app with a team of 5 in a 4 day sprint in a fully remote environment.  This team had members of varying skill levels.  One person in particular felt like he wasn't able to contribute very much to the project code-wise.  I was the leader of this team, and before we got started, I asked everyone to talk a little about what they wanted to work on, what they would like to learn more about, and where they felt they could use the most help.  I divided up the tasks accordingly, and made sure to include the team member who had less confidence in his skills in pair-programming and research tasks to give him an opportunity to learn, which helped him to feel better about his role and contributions to the project.  We deployed the application, hitting our MVP, and were able to include most of our stretch goals for the project.

1. Tell me about a time you worked with a good team, what that felt like, and what your part in it was.
-I worked on a full-stack stargazing application on a team with 3 other people in a 4 day sprint in a fully remote environment.  I loved working with this team, because we kept ourselves open, flexible, and had a good sense of humor when things didn't work out how we anticipated.  We all took the first day to plan the application, do research, talk about our wire frames, possible features, new libraries we might want to use and why, and write out tickets.  This was my brainchild, and I did a lot of research into APIs we could use to accomplish our goals for the application.  Unfortunately, finding an API that would return the results we needed was extremely difficult.   We had initially planned our app around finding an API of constellations but the closest thing I could find were two graphical simulation planetariums. We chose Virtual Sky for our planetarium and we decided to supplement that data with a weather API which returned an object that included astronomical data like sunset, moonrise, moon phase and moon illumination to give the user more data for planning their stargazing excursions.  The result was a really fun, interactive, feature-rich app that had a lot of UX consideration.  It was well-rounded, and the most fun project I've ever worked on.
