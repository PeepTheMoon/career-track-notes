Elevator pitch:


(make pitch about the needs of my listener, and talk about the problems facing their company that I am uniquely positioned to solve, then describe my value in solving these problems.)


I am a lover of learning and a creative and analytical problem solver.  I’m adept at thinking strategically and pioneering new ideas that generate novel solutions.  
My greatest strength is my desire to help others.  I’m a full-stack software developer and I  seek to empower people to improve their quality of life through technology.
I’m interested in opportunities to develop innovative apps that people will wonder how they ever lived without.  Can I reach out to you on LinkedIn?
  -sounds resume-buzzword-ish and not conversational.


# 3 aspects to a good elevator pitch:
1. Who you are
2. Why you're qualified
3. Why you're here

*I’m Rachel, a full-stack software engineer with a background in critical media studies and nutrition.  I’ve always enjoyed helping others improve their lives.  This led me to found a business on the health-food industry where I focused on nutritional consultations and science-based education in direct consumer marketing.  After 15 years in my company, I wanted to learn new things, be more challenged, and work on more complex problems, so I turned my attention to software engineering.  Through software development, I learned that I derive deep satisfaction from working closely with others on a shared goal, which is why I’m so excited about working at a company like yours.  Would you like have a virtual coffee meeting and discuss the opportunity further?  I’d love to connect on with you LinkedIn!*
