# Tell me about yourself:
*I’m Rachel, a full-stack software engineer with a background in critical media studies and nutrition.  I’ve always enjoyed helping others improve their lives.  This led me to found a business on the health-food industry where I focused on nutritional consultations and science-based education in direct consumer marketing.  After 15 years in my company, I wanted to learn new things, be more challenged, and work on more complex problems, so I turned my attention to software engineering.  Through software development, I learned that I derive deep satisfaction from working closely with a diverse group of people on a shared goal, which is why I’m so excited about working at a company like yours.*
