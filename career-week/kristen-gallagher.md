 At the interview:

 - talk to the front desk person
 - ask for succinct examples about how the company lives its values.

 A company's values/operating principles are their metrics for success and you'll often be judged by them.

 A good questions to ask in the first interview is tell me how your emplyees live your companies values.

 second interview, tell me about your onboarding process
  ask broader questions in the beginning, and more pointed, specific questions later on.

  May be a good idea to research how the company you're looking at got its money!

My Why:
I am excited about the opportunity to always be learning, to create something that is helpful and improves the lives of others, to think strategically and deeply about complex problems and work to solving those problems on a collaborative team.

Three things to help keep the stamina going for a job search:
1. focus and your why
