promise.all is an array of promises that all happen at the exact same time, instead of waiting for some to finish.  

if you put a return before your copy it will wait for the copy to finish before returning it.  <copy funcion from promises lab, test>

promise.resolve takes promises and resolves with the value we put in the parenthesis.

async functions always return promises.
