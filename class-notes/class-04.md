When we have a problem, we have three stages to solve:
 1. Input- needs a parse function into an actionObj{ type, payload } and a valid function.  No reason to use a class for these two functions.

 2. Execute- add (create), list (find), delete

 3. Output- display notes( for both create note action and delete note action), and display a list of notes.  transfers nicely to react components!
