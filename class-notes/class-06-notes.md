TCP connections are like calls.   It's a bidirectional pipe of communication, but before tht connection is established, a three part handshake must be go through to establish that connection.  
Ring = Syn
Hello = Syn-Ack
Hi = Ack
```
client.on('data', data => {
//this is an event listener
});

same as .addEventListener('click', event => {});
```
