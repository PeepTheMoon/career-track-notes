```npm i chance``` to create random data.  ```const chance = require('chance').Chance();```

when aggregating data, using ```project``` is kind of like mapping over data and returns the same amount of items in an array, but you are manipulating the info in that array.  For example, if you only want specific fields from a document, rename, or even add a field, but it returns the same amount of documents in the array.
