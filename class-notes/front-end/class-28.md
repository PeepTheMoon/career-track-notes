presentational componenets are stateless functional components.  They deal with how things look, will be passed state as props, and display those props in some way.

class components deal with state

Service/model layer - how the data looks

container component - contains/uses the presentational component and passes state as props to the presentational component

presentation/view layer - how to display the data.  markup

anything dealing with state will be in a container component.

whenever you have an arrow function, you can drop the curly braces to implicitly return something.  If you use curly braaces, its a code black and you need to put a eturn satement in it.

implicit returns are cool bruh
