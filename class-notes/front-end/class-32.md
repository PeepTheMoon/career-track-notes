custom hooks have access to the react cycle, manage their own state internally and export data, methods, or both.

higher order components:
they are functions.  Usually you start higher order components with the word "with".
since it's a component, it gets passed props and with those props you construct your component.

you need to use bracket notation for computed properties.

pagination is basically an incrementer and decrementer and in your useEffect you update state based on that new number.
