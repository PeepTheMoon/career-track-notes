Thanks for your time!!

What brought you to Allen?

was a chemist.  liked software, research institute.  

I see you've worked at the Allen Institute for Brain Science for 4 years.  Can you describe the work culture?  What do you love about working here?

I'd love to learn more about how different department collaborate at the institute.

I was looking into the github code for the array tomography pipeline.  I read that it's a tool for imaging the molecular structures of neural circuits and allows scientists to visualize previously unseen features of brain molecular architecture.  That's amazing!  Can you tell me more about your work on this project?

the thin slices of brain are imaged by flourescent.  definded the array tomography pipeline.

I see it was done using a lot of python and java.  Are these the languages you use most?

I'm interested in data visualization.  Can you tell me what libraries/frameworks your team uses for data viz on top of python and java?
python!  mj- image processing library in java.  Totte works mostly in c++.  
python is better for prototyping.  c++ takes longer but is more robust

check out vtk!  python front end.

What are you looking for in a data viz engineer? 

learn about the projects, more about neuroscience.  Python, java, vtk, more like d3, etc.  graphql is a query language.

learn more about machine learning!!

Is there any advice you have for someone interested in data viz work at the allen institute?
