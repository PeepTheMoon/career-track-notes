Professional strategies-
network.  quality of the networking counts.  Do what works for you (me, smaller scale).
Go to events whose topics interest you.  

Professional strategies:
research the person you're cold-calling.
Personalize your opening message
Plan and suggest the logistics of the meeting

Build relationships before leaning on them:
People are people first.
Expect that good relationships take time to bear fruit
Find good mentors and advocates and know the difference
Your cohort mates are your first and future colleagues.

Embrace the coding bootcamp background:
Know the project like the back of your hand.
WHat is the user story and who are the stakeholders?
How did you go from the ideal product to the MVP?
Can you draw out the architecture on a whiteboard?
Can you describe the stack and walk through the code?
Can ou critically describe the good, bad and lessons to learn?
What would you change and add to different versions?

Don't hide your background:
draw connections between your past and present.
Add personal interests and esoteria to humanize, no commoditize.

Be open minded about opportunities but specific about interests:
be flexible, not indecisive.

Admit your gaps abd redirect to your strengths
Admit when you don't know something.  If you don't have the exact answer/skill but if you have a reasonable alternative, propose it.

Embrace the coding bootcamp background
show initiative and reflection post-interview:
Ask the interviewer for feedback and how to prepare for the next round.
A follow-up email addressing soemthing in the interview and show initiative and growth.
You may get asked the same questions/types of questions in the next round.

Coding strategies/ tips:

Pick a language or two and stick with it.
Some comapnies will give you an option to work with a preferred language
- don't over-anticipate learning for the interview based on your stack
Building a strong competency in one language will spill over to similar lanuages.
- ex: puthon, ruby, javascript can parallel like Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.

Don't use code and computers as crutches.
- everything you put to code is something you have to explain aloud.  
- don't commit right away, handwave with natural language and pseudocode
- writing on a whiteboard in a notebook forces you to not line-by-line debug.

effective time management and the big picture:
if we don't set good boundaries on time, we get distracted by shiny things.
Break down a coding problem into discrete phases:
-5 min scoping the problem, writing important info, notes, ask questions.
- 10 min create a roadmap for the solution in very general terms
25 min commit to writing code and refctoring
10 min discuss pros and cons, optimizations, etc.

Be visual and vocal when talking about code or software.
- if youre describing a service you worked on, draw the components and their relationships
- working in your head creates a painful silence and robs you of a resource (the interviewer)

HAve some libraries/frameworks/etc in your back pocket based on use case
think about "what am I doing" v "What am I using?"
1. "I want you to spin up a quick visualization to see time-series data from n API"

Collaborate with friends and colleagues
- agree on common problems everyone can work on together
- use a whiteboard, take turns roleplaying and collarboating on a challenge
- use repl to swap code on line if you can't meet in person.
- ask and be asked tough questions, and give specific, objective, constructive feedback.
- encourage and upport eachotehr through this process!

Arrange mock interviews with a mentor in the industry.
- leverages tips about building relationships

Find some fundamentals, data structures and algorithms references
- eloquent javascript
- Grokking Algorithms, Bhargava, Aditya (Python)
- Elements of Programming Interviews (multiple languages)
