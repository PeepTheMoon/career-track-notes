worked with data insigths in data from his lawyer days.

data engineering
analytics route


started full stack at vacasa, maintained a dahboard that took in market data and wrapped it into a model to help predict future prices for a rental, accounting for trends, seasonal trends, regional trends, etc, to generate predictions about price.  He would then use that to make imprivements on his model, and also figure out how to incorporate the data into the pipeline.

Also used data scraping to amplify their own data sets.  Figured out how to move data from the cloud into his data structure.  

Found he was interested in the user stories and stakeholder stuff- how is this data relevant?  Also had a larger analytics role, like where people are applying for jobs, what stort of jobs theyre interested in, figuring out what types of visualizations/rollups that would communicate that best.

Then moved to how give their clients the data they want/need to do their own analytics.  

Data pipeline stuff (cloud services, etc).

jupityr notebooks
python
numpy
pandas

matplotlib

was asked for his interview at flux to take public payscale data and look at it, think about interesteing trends, and then report on it.

Check out Tufty- a "visualization god"
WEB DuBois did visualizations!  Check them out.

ask what the limitations of different types of visualizations?  Creative ways to visualize info.  

Check out commonly used terms for definitions of metrics- ways to talk about data

can construct your own data set with things like airtable (amped up version of google sheets).  Can generate a dynamic api based off of the spreadsheet structure.  

amcharts- has good documentation
chart.js
SQL

Think about things from that user angle.  Create queries that are responsive.  

play around with sql in leetcode, too <3

mode analytics has a free tier but must have own private database to feed into it.
