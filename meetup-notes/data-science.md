## 5 v's of big data:
- Volume (how much it is, how large the database is)
the more volume you have the better you can test for accuracy
- Velocity - how long will it take to acquire the data?
- Veracity - does it come from a reliable source?
- Variety (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data)
- Value - what happens with the data when we combine it with an algorithm.  

mentioned Pandas (which uses Python) and R  Python and R are key programming languages to data science.  What is numpy, Jupyter Notebooks?  Kaggle is a good place to find data sets to practice on!

Algorithms are good at sorting and predicting from big data

As a data scientist you will focus on 
1. Linear Regression Algorithms
are the algorithms that helps us to see how things will move in the future
1. Classifier algorithm
a decision tree algorithm can help us to decide among many options (like a route in a maps app for example)

Think of an algorithm like a recipe or a set of instructions/steps to accomplish a task.

Once you've chosen a data set, you want to clean it, then visualize it.  One of the ways to clean data is to normalize it, for axmple if height was input incorrectly, you can take the average height and use that for that specific piece of data.

Another way to clean data is to remove values from data sets that can cause bias.  

Once you have a data set, you want to clean it, sort it, visualize it.

Visualize it with things like
- histogram allows you to look at one feature at a time and the occurrence/frequency of that feature.
- scatter plots allow you to create a fit line ( a line that hits as many data points as possible to get a liner read of some data)
- bar chart allows you to compare things easily
- pie chart
- correlation matrix tells us how closely related different features/data points are related in a data set.

Visualizing your data first will allow you to make a more educated decision about which type of algorithm you will want to use on the data based on the stories the data tells.

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data

Data science is interdisciplinary and uses the scientific method.

Scientific method seven step algorithm:
1. choose a problem you want to solve or a question you want to answer.
1. Decide on a set of actions you think you can use t co solve or answer it.
1. Test your idea.hypothesis.  Perform the set of actions.
1. Collect and analyze the results(data.). what does the info mean?
1. Draw a conclusion.
1. Share your conclusion (what you learned.achieved).
1. Repeat steps 2-5 until you discover a solution or answer.

What kind of questions should you ask?

1. Can the experiment or observation be repeated?  Same results/level of accuracy?
1. Why did the results occur?  What kinds of changes would affect the results (or accuracy)?
1. How would you change the experiment design or method of observation?  Optimization?  How would you measure the results?
1. What are the conclusions reached about the results?  Could the same results be interpreted in a different way?

### Data Science and Math
Linear algebra is something that will be really helpful.  It uses the slope intercept formula and linear regression.

Probability -> statistics -> classifiers

Calculus -> lagrance multiplier -> support vectors.

                      Statistics

        tests                            theorems

a/b tests    p value             naive bayes      probability

#### Machine learning

There are two different types of machine learning:
1. supervised  supervised learning takes labeled data, runs it through an algorithm, and then it gets sorted before the output.  This is training the computer via data labelling.  This way when unlabelled data gets entered, you can test whether the algorithm is working. 
        Training set(20%of your data set)
        Test set(80% of your data set)
        Adjust existing parameters contained in the model (i.e. the algorithm)
        Add new parameters (i.e. add additional instructions)

1. unsupervised- you have raw input data, not labelled.  You're asking the algorithm to find its own correlations.  It has unknown output and no training data set(labelled data).  With this type of machine learning, you have to ask why things were grouped together and whether or not that was useful.  
        Adjust existing parameters contained in the model(i.e. algorithm)
        Add new parameters (i.e. add additional instructions)

Goal: accuracy!

Rune the model!  Tell the algorithm to work on the data and give you result.s 
1. Test the accuracy of your models' predictions or classifications.
        - Accuracy Test
        - KFold Validation
        - Cross Validation
These will help you to find out if you have an outlier that is throwing off your data.

1. Create new visualizations using these results
        - Histogram
        -Scatter Plot
        -Line Graph
        - Bar chart
        - Pie chart
Allows to check your results visually.  Allows you to check your parameters again and reevaluate your parameters.  


Optimize the model(algorithm)
Goal: increased accuracy

1. Adjust existing parameters contained in the model (i.e. algorithm)
1. Add new parameters (add additional instructions)
1. Engineer and add new features
1. Check for and eliminate features that cause noise or bias
1. Run your model again
6. Evaluate the accuracy of your model.  Has it increased or decreased?
1. You may need to repeat this process many times.
