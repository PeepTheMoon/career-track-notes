Get about 20% raise every time you change jobs

It's important to talk about money withy our peers so you can make sure you're being paid fairly.

Instead of saying no when someone asks you what your previous salary was, say things like what is the range for this position, or I agreed not to disclose my salary 

When an offer comes, get off the phone!  You're not in a position to discuss it further.  Say you need to look into something like student loans, whatever.  Say you'll get bck to them, that you appreciate the offer and the team and love the company, but say you'll think about it, double check things, and get back to them.  See if it's fair and that it's enough.  Say you'll need to see if you can take money off the table, etc.  Be polite but firm.

After your first offer, you can continue to negotiate, usually up to 15% more.  And ask for double the options they offer.  Say if you're able to meet me at this number, then I will sign today...  You're offering them the close.

Try to negotiate over email rather than phone.

They will usually come back and give another offer.  They will be more reticent to offer more on salary than options.  

Usually people stay at company for about 1.5-2 years.

Autonomy, mastery and purpose are what drive nd motivate people.  You need at least 2 of those things to enjoy your job.

love on the spectrum

ask if a company participates in diversity and equity initiates.



MARTY'S TALK:

Wanting a job is the worst way to get one.  Saying you're open to anything and everything reads as "nothing" to the person.  Have opinions, goals.

Set yourself up as a contributor- you know the tools and technologies and can make contributions.

Ask an interviewer what their role on the team is.

Ask why their hiring for this position?  Did someone leave?  Find out what that person did.  You'll need to be at least as good.  Is it a growth hire?  More latitude for a team hire, but more picky.

Big picture- what does this position mean strategically for the company.  Find that connection and learn about their level of urgency.

One of the biggest hacks into working at a tech company: clean, maintainable code!

Show that you can make contributions.  Avoid red flag, jump in now, look for where you can jump in in 3-6 months.

Red flags:
1. appearing generally unskilled.
2. being sloppy
3. not being able to talk about recent work in technical detail.
4. not having any recent work or projects to talk about.
5. not having technical interests

Interviewing tips:

Act like a new hire!
Be prepared, do your research!
Approach all interviews with integrity
- be honest and transparent
- be real and authentic
Know your strategy
- don't divulge all of your shortcomings
- frame yourself
- based on claiming your territory.
Don't speak generally
- give examples based in work you've done
answers based in real experience
- usually good regardless of the outcome
- having a hard time with specific tech or outright failing are great stories
- getting into pros/cons discussions is a win

When you don't know:
- clearly define what you know well in relation to the questions
- ask an intelligent counter question
- helps if you know a tidbit about what they're asking

example:
- we use django on the backend
- my web server experience has been with node.js using express to create restful APIs.  can you tell me more about that?

Dev process questions
How often do you release?
- are they doing Continuous Delivery (CD)?
- if not, the process has overhead
How much time does it typically take between when a dev is done with features and a product is released?
- often a QA hardeing phase
How do you interact with product management?  Are project managers available, and how much of the time?

Ask devs what sort of tech debt does this project have?

If managers couldn't think of new features and you had a month to work on whatever, what would you choose?


If they feel comfortable with you technically and you feel like a teammate, you'll likely be offered the job.
