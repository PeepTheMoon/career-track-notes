//user enters the location
//a description is given: 

//You slam the door to the house and barricade the door. You don't have long before the horde tears this house apart. You take in your location and see a garage, living room, kitchen, and bedroom.

//there's a boarded up window keeping a threat at bay, maybe a cornoavirus-addled zombie group?  A pile of wood sits on the floor next to the window

//in the location, the user sees what looks like a broken down old vehicle and a rusty toolbox, a dusty desk full of papers and test tubes and notebooks with vaccine experiments.  Everything appears very old and some of the writing is smudged and illegible.  
  //this is where the key is but the user has to interact with the desk to find it

//there is a kitchen area with a sink and used dishes stacked around it. There are a few dented cans of food, but otherwise the cabinets are empty


//hub is the library.  completed room = library card punched
//each book is it's own room
