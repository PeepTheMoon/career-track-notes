Accessibility Trees

importance of semantic HTML tags (avoid <div>, <span>, etc.)  You can use dev tools and the inspect tool to see how accessible your page/site is and if keyboards and screen readers can access certain elements

accessibility APIs
  - microsoft active accessibility [msaa] with iaccessible2
  - user interface automation [ui-automation]
  - accessibility toolkit [atk] and assistive technology service provider interface [at-spi]
  - macos accessibility protocol [axapi]

wearia(sp?) - web accessibility initiative.  it can help you to expose <div> and <spans> tags to screen readers.  

There's a vscode screen reader friendly mode!

accessibility testing - the pack yellow group, dq(sp?), mozilla web docs, google accessibility docs are great resources.  use tutorials to learn to use screen readers.  Informs you of what to expect.  Keyboard testing is the first thing, super important to be sure you're matching the visual with the focus order.  Get familiar with using your keyboard without using a mouse.

There's usually a preferred pairing of screen readers to browsers.   Voiceover pairs with safari.  voiceover isn't optimized for chrome.  Be cognizant of the issues and test with the preferred pairings of browsers.
