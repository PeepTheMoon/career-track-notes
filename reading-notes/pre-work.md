Steps to take when solving programming problems:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
Be sure you know what the problem is and understand the problem.  

1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
Write the manual steps down complete with why's (see if there are duplicate why's).

1. Optimize the manual steps.
What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
Write in comments the steps you will need to take.  This allows us to see the structure of the code that we will write. 

1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

    1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
    1. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs.  Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

    1. Create a list
    1. Sort a list or array
    1. Create a map or dictionary
    1. Loop through a list, or dictionary
    1. Parse strings
    1. Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

1. Optimize the real code.
It’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.  Get rid of duplication.  Cjec that your variables have meaningful names.  

As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.  DOnt' dive right in to writing code.

Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.

This method of tackling a problem is called “divide and conquer” and is quite effective.  A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

The five whys and five hows technique: by repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.

The five whys are used for drilling down into a problem and the five hows are used to develop the details of a solution to a problem. Both are designed to bring clarity and refinement to a problem statement or a potential solution and get to the root cause or root solution.

How to become a better problem solver: 

1. Understand
Know what is being asked.  How to know if you undertand is when you can explain it.  

“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

2. Plan
To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!

3. Divide
Break one large problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Begin with the simplest sub-problem, them move on to other sub-problems that don't depend on others being solved.  After solving sub-problems, connect the dots.  

Sometimes it's best to delete everything and start fresh.  

Don't forget the value of research.  Someone has probably solved your problem.  TIP: only look for solutions to sub problems- you need to struggle a bit to learn.

4. Practice
 If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

 Games are a good way to do this: Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties
